"""What the MCP tools actually do, with no MCP in sight.

The protocol layer above is decoration: decorators, docstrings and JSON
schemas. Everything worth testing -- which document types each tool selects,
how an unknown type is reported, what happens when nothing matches -- lives
here, so the tests need a store and a search service rather than a client
session and a subprocess.
