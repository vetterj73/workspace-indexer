"""Lists that exist in more than one place must agree.

Every entry here is a real failure this project has already had, generalised.
The pattern is always the same: something is enumerated in code and enumerated
again somewhere else -- a doc, a test, a second backend's index definition --
and the copy drifts. Nothing errors; the second list simply describes a system
that no longer exists.

Three of these were found the expensive way. `impact_of` shipped and the stdio
test kept asserting the four tools that existed before it, green because CI
deselects integration tests. The reference doc's tool list was hand-typed and
passed happily while a tool went undocumented. A filter field declared in one
index and not the other produces a search that silently ignores the filter.

The rule this file encodes: if a list appears twice, one of them is derived, or
a test proves they match.
