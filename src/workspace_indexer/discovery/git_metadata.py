    competing in search, and -- worse, because it is silent -- route resolution
    finding two files for one endpoint and resolving to neither.

    Cheap by construction, because this is asked of every directory descended
    into. A worktree's `.git` is a *file* rather than a directory, so a missing
    or directory `.git` answers no without running git at all; only the handful
    of directories that could be one cost a subprocess.

    That file test is necessary but not sufficient: a submodule's `.git` is a
    file too, and excluding vendored submodule code would be a real loss. The
    distinguishing fact is that a worktree borrows its repository's object
    store, so its git-dir sits inside the common dir rather than being it --
    verified against a real worktree and a real submodule, because the
    tempting shorter test gets submodules wrong.
