A semantic + keyword index over this workspace. Use it instead of grepping when
you know *what* you want but not *where* it is.

- search_code -- implementation, with tests and generated files excluded.
- find_guidance -- specifications and design documents only. Reach for this
  before writing new code, especially when there is nothing yet to imitate.
- get_file_context -- every indexed chunk of one file, in order.
- list_document_types -- what kinds of document this workspace actually holds,
  with counts. A count of zero is a real answer: it means look at the code.
- impact_of -- what one file imports and, more usefully, what imports it.
  Call this before changing a signature, and before deleting anything.
- grounding -- whether a repository records *why* it is the way it is. Call
  this when find_guidance comes back empty, before concluding anything from
  that emptiness: it says whether the answer is missing from the index or was
  never written down. Where it reports `absent`, say the rationale is
  unrecorded rather than inferring one.
