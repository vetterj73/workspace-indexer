"""The SQLite manifest that drives incremental reindexing.

Deliberately synchronous. SQLite here is local single-file I/O measured in
microseconds, and wrapping each of tens of thousands of tiny queries in
asyncio.to_thread would cost more in executor hand-off than the queries
themselves. Writes are batched into transactions instead.

Not stored in Qdrant because the hot path is millions of cheap existence checks
against a local file, and because this has to survive swapping the vector store
out entirely.
