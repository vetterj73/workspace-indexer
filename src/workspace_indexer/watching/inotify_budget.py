"""How many inotify watches a tree needs, against how many the kernel allows.

`/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` caps watches per *user*, not per
process -- often 65536, sometimes 8192, and shared with every editor, language
server and file manager already running. A workspace containing `node_modules`
will exhaust it.

This is the other reason our ignore rules matter. They are not only about index
quality: they are what keeps the watcher functional at all. Exhausting the
limit surfaces as `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` from
`inotify_add_watch`, which is one of the least helpful error messages in Linux
-- it has nothing to do with disk space.
