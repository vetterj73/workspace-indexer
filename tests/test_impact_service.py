"""The dependency graph, as an agent sees it.

Every test here runs against a real SQLite manifest holding a real graph.
The queries are SQL and the joins are the thing that can be wrong, so a mocked
manifest would assert our idea of the query rather than the query.

The failure this file is mostly guarding against is not a wrong number. It is
a *plausible* empty answer: an agent told "nothing imports this" about a file
in an unscanned language, or about the wrong file, will delete working code.
