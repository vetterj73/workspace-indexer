"""Every setting must be read by something.

A setting that nothing reads is worse than a setting that does not exist. It is
documented, it appears in `.env.example`, someone sets it, and nothing happens
-- silently, with no error and no log line, which is the failure mode this
project keeps running into from a new direction.

It had already happened twice when this was written. `RERANK_ENABLED` and
`RERANK_MODEL` were declared in `Settings`, listed in the reference and copied
into `.env.example`, and read by nothing at all: the reranker is built from
`config.search.rerank`, so the two settings sat next to it doing nothing. I
found them by setting `RERANK_MODEL=database:rerank-2.5-lite` to benchmark
server-side reranking, watching a client-side Voyage reranker run instead, and
nearly reporting the resulting numbers as a measurement of something else.
