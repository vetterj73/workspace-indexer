"""Turn a discovery candidate into a SourceFile.

This is the first point at which a file is opened. Discovery deliberately
stops short of it, so the manifest's mtime/size fast path can skip a file
without paying for a read.

Classification up to here was extension-only. This is where a claim like "this
.txt is text" gets checked against the actual bytes, and a file that does not
decode is downgraded to OPAQUE rather than indexed as mojibake.
