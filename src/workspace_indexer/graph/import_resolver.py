"""Turning an import string into a file that exists.

Rung 2 of #34. Rung 1 recorded what the source wrote; this decides which
indexed file it meant, for the cases that can be settled without a build
system.

Resolution is scoped to the importing file's own unit -- its repository. An
import inside one repo names something in that repo, and reaching across
repositories needs a workspace-wide symbol table, which is rung 3. Keeping the
scope narrow is also what makes an answer trustworthy: two repos routinely
contain the same package name, and a resolver that guesses between them is
worse than one that declines.

What it deliberately does not do:

- **tsconfig path aliases.** `@/hooks/useThing` needs tsconfig.json parsed and
  its `paths` applied relative to `baseUrl`. Real work, and until it exists an
  alias resolves to nothing rather than to something plausible.
- **node_modules.** `react` is a package, not a file in this workspace.
- **C# namespaces.** `using MyApp.Data` names no path at all; it needs every
  `namespace` declaration collected first.
