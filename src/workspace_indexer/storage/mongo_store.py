"""A VectorStore over MongoDB Atlas.

The second implementation of the storage seam, and the point of having had a
protocol at all: nothing above `storage/` changes to run on it. The payload is
built by the same `to_payload` and read back by the same `to_search_hit` as
Qdrant, so a chunk means the same thing on either backend and the eval numbers
from one are comparable with the other.

Three things genuinely differ, and each is a deliberate decision rather than an
accident of the driver:

**The sparse half is Lucene, not fastembed.** Qdrant stores a BM25 sparse
vector we compute locally; Atlas has its own inverted index and no way to
accept ours. So `upsert` takes the sparse vector and ignores it, and the
keyword branch of hybrid search is a `$search` stage over the same text. This
is not a downgrade -- Lucene computes IDF across the collection the same way
Qdrant's `Modifier.IDF` does -- but it is a different implementation of the
same idea, and a recall difference between the backends should be read with
that in mind rather than blamed on the vectors.

**Vectors are stored as BSON binData, not arrays of doubles.** Measured on this
workspace's own index -- 11,049 chunks at 1024 dimensions -- the naive array
encoding costs 15.07 KB per document against 6.15 KB for binData float32:
162 MB versus 66 MB. On a Free cluster capped at 512 MB including indexes, that
difference is most of the budget.

**Fusion is server-side where the cluster allows it.** `$rankFusion` implements
RRF natively, but it is a rolling deployment across the Atlas 8.0 fleet. Rather
than guess from a version number, the first hybrid search tries it and falls
back to fusing client-side if the server rejects the stage. The fallback is the
same RRF formula, so results agree; it just costs two round trips instead of
one.
