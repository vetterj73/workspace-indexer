"""Exclusions that apply no matter what the user configures.

These are our own runtime state. A log file inside a watched root means the
watcher fires on our own writes, reindexes, writes more log lines, and spins
forever — not something a user should be able to configure themselves into.

Eval artefacts are here for the same reason in a different shape. A persisted
eval record quotes the query of every case verbatim, so indexing one makes it
a near-perfect lexical *and* semantic match for the very queries used to
measure retrieval quality — the measurement then scores our own output
instead of the workspace. A correctness rule, not a preference, so it does
not live in the user-editable exclude list.
