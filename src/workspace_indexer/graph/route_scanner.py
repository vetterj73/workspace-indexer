"""What endpoints a file exposes, and what endpoints a file calls.

Rung 1 of #53, and deliberately the same shape as the import scanner's rung 1:
extract the token the source actually wrote, resolve nothing, and report
coverage. Whether resolution is worth building is a question about numbers, and
this is what produces them.

The two halves are not symmetric, and measuring a real ASP.NET + React
workspace before writing anything is what showed how unsymmetric they are.

**Server side is nearly free.** Every `[Route(...)]` carried a literal
template -- 66 of 66 -- and *no* `[HttpGet]`/`[HttpPost]` carried one at all,
so the route always lives on a separate `[Route]` attribute. 17 of those sat on
a class and 36 on a method, and 11 were empty, which in ASP.NET means "exactly
the class route". So an effective route is the class template joined to the
action template, and that join is the whole extraction.

**Client side is where this is won or lost.** Of 32 `fetch` call sites, 3 used
a plain string literal, 11 a template literal, and 18 a variable or expression.
So a scanner that only understands literals sees under a tenth of the calls.
Template literals give up their static prefix, which is why `RouteCall.exact`
exists -- most edges that resolve at all will resolve through a prefix, and
recording them as exact would overstate the graph.
