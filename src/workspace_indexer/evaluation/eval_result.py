    Case-insensitive, because Linux paths are case-sensitive but a case
    mismatch in a hand-written dataset is a typo rather than a meaningful
    distinction -- and scoring a successful retrieval as a miss because the
    dataset said CONTRIBUTING.md while the file is docs/contributing.md makes
    the measurement lie.

    Deliberately takes two strings rather than a string and a list: the two
    call sites iterate in opposite directions, and a (str, list[str]) signature
    lets them be swapped silently, since both orderings typecheck.
